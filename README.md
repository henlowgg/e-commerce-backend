## Description
This is a command line tool to create a new E-Commerce-Backend project. It implements sequelize and express to manage the database and the server. It also implements the authentication and authorization. It also implements the routes for the different pages. I was able to successfully learn sequelize due to the nature of the project and have a good understanding of these tools because of the experience.
